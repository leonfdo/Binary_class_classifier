# Binary_class_classifier

In this project I have developed a binary classifier model to classify the points in  two circle  which was taken by sklearn make_blobs data set.

first data was imported by the sklearn library and then converted to panda dataframe to get better idea about the data set. Then the data is visualized using matplotlib library to have a good view of the data.

then, training and testing data sets are created from the data. In this model, ReLU served as the activation function for two linear layers. Here, the loss function was Binary Cross entropy with Logits, and the optimizer was the SGD algorithm. Finally, the model was trained, and after running on the training set, the final outcomes were discovered.
